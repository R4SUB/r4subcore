Description: Foundational package in the R4SUB ecosystem. Defines the core
    evidence table schema, parsers, indicator abstractions, and scoring
    primitives needed to quantify clinical submission readiness. Provides a
    standardized contract for ingesting heterogeneous sources (validation
    outputs, metadata, traceability) into a single evidence framework.
